# pyacaia

Python module to interact with Acaia scales (https://acaia.co/collections/coffee-scales) via Bluetooth (BLE). 

Note: If you are using the Acaia Lunar 2021 edition, make sure to update the firmware, otherwise the commands will not work (e.g. tare, start timer etc).

This code was inspired by the javascript version available here https://github.com/bpowers/btscale

## 0. Requirements
Linux, Python (>=2.7 or >=3.5) and  bluepy (https://github.com/lucapinello/bluepy)
(pygatt >=4.0.3 is also partially supported https://github.com/peplin/pygatt;
 Pyxis not supported under pygatt)

This package has been tested on a RasperryPI ZeroW with Raspbian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch) and on Ubuntu Linux 20.04, and with the Lunar and Pyxis scales.

## 1. Install with:

`pip install pyacaia`

## 2. Short example
```python
import time
from pyacaia import AcaiaScale

scale = AcaiaScale(mac='00:1C:97:17:FD:97')

scale.auto_connect() # to pick the first available

# Or if you know the address use:
# scale.connect()

# battery value in percent
print(scale.battery)

# scale units is 'grams' or 'ounces'
print(scale.units)

# minutes of idle before auto-off
print(scale.auto_off)

# will the scale beep when a button is pressed?
if scale.beep_on:
    print('It beeps!')
else:
    print('It is silent!')

# is the timer running?
if scale.timer_running:
    print('Timer is running')

# elapsed time is in seconds, if timer is paused
# the value will be the displayed time
# Due to bluetooth transit time, the value
# may be slightly different than displayed
print('Elapsed time:', scale.get_elapsed_time())

# Tare the scale
scale.tare()

# Control the timer
scale.startTimer()
time.sleep(2)
scale.stopTimer()
scale.resetTimer()

# Read and print the weight every 0.5 sec for 5 sec
for i in range(10):
    print(scale.weight) # this is the property we can use to read the weigth in real time
    time.sleep(0.5)

    # Check if the scale is still connected, perhaps it was turned off?
    if not scale.connected:
        break

scale.disconnect()
``` 

Pyacaia now calls bluepy's `Peripheral.waitForNotifications()` internally.  If your application uses `waitForNotications()` directly with 0.3.0 or earlier, that call should be removed.

By default the backend used is `bluepy`, but also `pygatt` is supported. In that case use:
```python
scale = AcaiaScale(mac='00:1C:97:17:FD:97', backend='pygatt')
```

## 3. Other functions that may be helpful
Find and list all the acaia scales that are on and in range:

```python
addresses = find_acaia_devices()
```

Print BLE charachteristic of the first available acaia in the list of addresses:

```python
if addresses:
    print_acaia_characteristics(addresses[0])
else:
    print('No Acaia devices found')
```
